  # **Actionable Insights**
   - The e-commerce sector has shown considerable amount of growth in the time period provided and is likely to grow further.
   - There is a decent difference between estimated delivery date and actual delivery date. Estimated delivery date is generally higher than the actual delivery date.
   - Close to 56% orders are placed between 12:00:01 UTC to 23:00:00 UTC.
   - Most of the people are comfortable in paying for their orders in one go.
   - Most of the customers are concentrated in SP, RJ and MG.
   - More than 55% have rated their purchase 5.
   - Majority of people who have rated 1 and 2 are not satisfied with the product.
 # **Recommendations**
   - Estimated delivery date calculation algorithm needs to be fixed since it's pretty inaccurate.
   - More targeted marketing campaigns can be run between 12:00:01 and 23:00:00 UTC since the people in Brazil mostly order within this time period.
   - Since , most of the orders are from Sao Paulo , Rio De Janeiro and Minas Gerais, awareness needs to be spread in the rest of the states which hardly had people placing orders.
   - Time taken to deliver is generally on the higher side which needs to be reduced by taking appropriate measures like automated logistics software, setting up new warehouses, inventory update etc.
   - Since most of the people rating 1 and 2 are not satisfied with the product, product quality needs to be improved.
   - Since 73% payments are made through credit cards, several benefits(like coupons, cashbacks and vouchers) must be provided to the credit card users to promote customer retention.
